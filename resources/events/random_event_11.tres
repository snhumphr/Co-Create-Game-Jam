A royal alchemist, sent along to aid in the creation of the elixit, advises that they need water to recover quickly.
Unfortunately, the lands you are passing through are barren and dry, and the water aboard is needed for the engine.

If you ration the water, the crew will take longer to recover, slowing the train's speed.

But if you open the train's stores without restraint, then your fuel reserves will be dangerously low."
