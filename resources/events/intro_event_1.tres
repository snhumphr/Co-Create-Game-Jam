The power which once linked the known world with iron rail, is now so weak that [color=red]He[/color] can barely stand unassisted.

Summoned to the royal court, you were given a task: The [color=red]King[/color]'s alchemists have devised an elixir, using the far-flung resources of the grand kingdom to cheat death.

You, and your train, are to collect the ingredients for the great elixir, and return them. 

A dangerous journey, through baneful fog and ill-kept rail, but success will earn you great renown. But if you fail... [color=red]His[/color] wrath will be considerable.
