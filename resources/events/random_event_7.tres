They seem to know your task, and claim to have been sent ahead to procure the ingredients of the elixir.
Their train was taken by bandits, but the emissary was thankfully able to recover the ingredient: A strange black powder.

...Or you could decline, fearing fraud. Some of those rents in their clothing seem like knife wounds."
